## Test LaTeX display

One can use Markdown editor such as MacDown (on OSX) which support rendering LaTeX match syntax. Otherwise, copy the markdown file URL (click the "Raw" button on top right) and open it by [StackEdit] in browser. Click the left menu icon --> "Import from URL" and paste the raw URL. Now the LaTeX equations can be beautifully shown. 

Here is some demo about LaTeX equations.  For the inline display, it is like $y = \mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbb{X} + b$.  For block display, it is like

$$e^{i\pi} = -1$$

Or in a more complex form,

$$\begin{align*}
x &= \frac{\sum_{i}^{N}\omega_i \times 10}{N} = y + \Delta_x\\
  &= c + d
\end{align*}$$

Should be awesome.
